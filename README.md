# Square-CFST-columns-ANN-prediction-models-BRA-LM
This repository contains user-friendly and practical models (Bayesian regularization and Levenberg-Marquardt models) for predicting the ultimate axial capacity of square CFST columns. These models can be applied to other areas as well, but they need to be adapted through the procedure of data normalization, validation, retraining and testing.

!!!Before you run the analysis you must specify the path of the dataset file to the designated place (filename)!!!

!!!To freeze your results which is important for comparison you must define random number in rng command!!!

!!!To run K-fold cross-validation technique you must specify number K!!!
