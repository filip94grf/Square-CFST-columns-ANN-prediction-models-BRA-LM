# Square-CFST-columns-ANN-prediction-models-BRA-LM
This repository contains user-friendly and practical models (Bayesian regularization and Levenberg-Marquardt models) for predicting the ultimate axial capacity of square CFST columns. These models can be applied to other areas as well, but they need to be adapted through the procedure of data normalization, validation and retraining and testing.
